*Baxter, the ”Robot Artist”
=============
University of Glasgow - Level 3 Team Project

The purpose of the project was to create a complex software system that would
allow a Baxter Research Robot to artistically draw human faces with a marker
pen onto a whiteboard. Face detection was used to capture faces, subsequently
making use of image processing tools to achieve high quality portrait images. 

In terms of robotic movement, inverse kinematics allowed Baxter to find the best
solutions for generating movement instructions for precise drawing. Thus, the
project set out to create a demonstration of the robot’s ability for University
open days, by combining computer vision and robotics to achieve artistic results.
